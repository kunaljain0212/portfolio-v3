React 19 is on the horizon, and it's packed with exciting new features. In this post, we'll explore the most significant changes and how they'll impact your development workflow.

## Concurrent Rendering Engine

One of the most anticipated features is the new concurrent rendering engine, which promises to make React applications even more responsive and efficient. This new engine allows React to pause and resume rendering work, leading to smoother user experiences, especially in complex applications.

Here's a simple example of how you might use this new feature:

```jsx
import { useTransition } from 'react';

function App() {
  const [isPending, startTransition] = useTransition();
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  function handleClick() {
    startTransition(() => {
      setCount(c => c + 1);
    });
  }

  return (
    <div>
      {isPending && <Spinner />}
      <button onClick={handleClick}>{count}</button>
    </div>
  );
}
