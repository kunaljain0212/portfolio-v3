      <p className="text-muted-foreground">
        I currently work at KoinX where I&apos;ve been part of the 0-1 journey
        handling everything thrown at me from frontend to backend, managing
        teams, leading product development, communicating cross-teams etc.  I
        have been a consistent and enthusiastic engineer for more than 4 years
        now and have shown a problem-solving attitude towards everything
        I&apos;ve worked on across the companies I&apos;ve worked at (Swiggy,
        FamPay, Trell). I am an engineer who can architect infrastructures and
        take complete ownership of making products/features live from scratch
        for end users.
